    <h4 class="mt-4">Register/Signup</h4>
    <div class="policy-desc mb-5">
    To make use of this app, you must be a registered user, though you can navigate our site, visit our blog, comment on articles without being a registered user but making use of the major features of this app (getting giveaways) requires you to be registered.
    Registration can either be through <a href=" url 'signupuser' ">Signup</a> or login through your social account.  When you register through the signup link, a verification will be sent to your email to verify/activate your account before you can proceed to login, so kindly ensure you fill an active email address.
    When you login for the first time, you will be redirected to update your account with details such as state of residence, gender, profile pic, phone number and the likes. Kindly ensure the correct details are entered as they will be used to communicate with you and without them you won't be able to see any giveaway in your state of residence.
    </div>
    <div class="policy-desc mb-5">
    If at any point in time, you relocate to another state, kindly update your account through the account settings link to continue to give and enjoy the available items in your present state of residence. For now you can only pick items within your state of residence.
    On the other hand, when you login through a social account,  you must first update your account through the account settings link by providing your data to the blank fields as this will make us have a means of communicating with you as well as enable you to see the available items in your state of residence.
